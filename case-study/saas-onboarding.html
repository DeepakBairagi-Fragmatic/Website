                                A fast-growing B2B SaaS platform was facing a critical retention problem. While their
                                marketing team was successfully driving sign-ups, 60% of new users abandoned the
                                platform within the first week. We were brought in to reimagine the onboarding
                                experience, helping users discover value faster and reducing early-stage churn.

                                The platform was powerful but complex. New users were dropped into a blank dashboard
                                with no guidance, leading to "blank slate paralysis." They struggled to understand where
                                to start or how to configure the tool for their specific needs.

                                Data analysis showed that users who didn't complete the initial setup within 3 days were
                                80% likely to churn. The existing "onboarding" consisted of a long, generic email
                                sequence and a link to a 50-page documentation wiki.

                                in their first week that correlated with long-term retention.

                                We replaced the empty state dashboard with a "Getting Started" widget that tracked
                                progress. Completing tasks (e.g., "Invite a teammate," "Create your first project") was
                                gamified with progress bars and celebratory animations.

                                We focused on "frictionless friction." We added steps to the sign-up flow (the
                                personalization questions), which technically added friction, but actually increased
                                motivation by showing users that the product was tailored to them.

                                The visual design used the "Zeigarnik Effect"—the psychological principle that people

                                already 20% full (for creating an account) to encourage users to finish the rest.

                                We built the onboarding layer using React and a state machine to manage the complex
                                logic of the guided tour. This allowed us to handle edge cases (e.g., user leaves and
                                comes back) gracefully.

                                We integrated with Segment and Mixpanel to track every step of the funnel. This granular
                                analytics setup allowed us to see exactly where users were dropping off and iterate on
                                the copy and design in real-time.

                                Email triggers were synchronized with in-app behavior. If a user stalled on step 3, they
                                received a helpful tip via email related specifically to that step, rather than a
                                generic "Come back!" message.
